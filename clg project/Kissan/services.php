<h1>Seeding</h1>
<img src="images/plants.jpg" width="320" height="300" align="right" style="margin-left:10px; border:#666 solid 1px;" />
The fundamental factor in the process of seeding is dependent on the properties of both seed and the soil it is being planted in. The prior step associated
 with seeding is crop selection, which mainly consists of two techniques: sexual and asexual. Asexual technique includes all forms of the vegetative process
 such as budding, grafting and layering. Sexual technique involves growing of the plant from a seed. Grafting is referred to as the artificial method of 
propagation in which parts of plants are joined together in order to make them bind together and continue growing as one plant. Grafting is mainly applied 
to two parts of the plant: the dicot and the gymnosperms due to the presence of vascular cambium between the plant tissues: xylem and phloem. A grafted 
plant consists of two parts: first rootstock, which is the lower part of the plant that comprises roots and the lowest part of the shoot; second, the 
branches and primary stem, which consists of the upper and main part of the shoot which gradually develops into a fully nourished plant. Budding is 
another form of asexual reproduction in which the new plant develops from a productive objective source of the parent plant. It is a method in which a bud
 from the plant is joined onto the stem of another plant The plant in which the bud is implanted in eventually develops into a replica of the parent 
plant. The new plant can either divert its ways into forming an independent plant; however, in numerous cases it may remain attached and form various 
accumulations.

<h1>Seedling</h1>
<img src="images/seedling.webp" width="320" height="300" align="left" style="margin-right:10px; border:#666 solid 1px;"/>

Germination is a process by which the seed develops into a seedling. The vital conditions necessary for this process are water, air, temperature, 
energy, viability and enzymes. If any of these conditions are absent, the process cannot undergo successfully. Germination is also known as sprouting; <br />
it is also considered the first sign of life shown by a seed.A seedling is a young sporophyte developing out of a plant embryo from a seed. Seedling development starts with germination of the seed. A typical young seedling consists of three main parts: the radicle (embryonic root), the hypocotyl (embryonic shoot), and the cotyledons (seed leaves). The two classes of flowering plants (angiosperms) are distinguished by their numbers of seed leaves: monocotyledons (monocots) have one blade-shaped cotyledon, whereas dicotyledons (dicots) possess two round cotyledons. Gymnosperms are more varied. For example, pine seedlings have up to eight cotyledons. The seedlings of some flowering plants have no cotyledons at all. These are said to be acotyledons.

The plumule is the part of a seed embryo that develops into the shoot bearing the first true leaves of a plant. In most seeds, for example the sunflower, the plumule is a small conical structure without any leaf structure. Growth of the plumule does not occur until the cotyledons have grown above ground. This is epigeal germination. However, in seeds such as the broad bean, a leaf structure is visible on the plumule in the seed.

<h1>pollination</h1>
<img src="images/pollination.webp" width="320" height="300" align="right" style="margin-left:10px; border:#666 solid 1px;" />
The process of pollination refers to the transfer of pollen to the female organs of the plant. Optimum factors for ideal pollination are a relative 
humidity rate of 50–70% and temperature of 24.4 °C. If the humidity rate is higher than 90%, the pollen would not shed. Increasing air circulation is a 
favourable method of keeping humidity levels under control.Pollen germination has three stages; hydration, activation and pollen tube emergence. The pollen grain is severely dehydrated so that its mass is reduced, enabling it to be more easily transported from flower to flower. Germination only takes place after rehydration, ensuring that premature germination does not take place in the anther. Hydration allows the plasma membrane of the pollen grain to reform into its normal bilayer organization providing an effective osmotic membrane. Activation involves the development of actin filaments throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, which eventually become concentrated at the point from which the pollen tube will emerge. Hydration and activation continue as the pollen tube begins to grow. In conifers, the reproductive structures are borne on cones. The cones are either pollen cones (male) or ovulate cones (female), but some species are monoecious and others dioecious. A pollen cone contains hundreds of microsporangia carried on (or borne on) reproductive structures called sporophylls. Spore mother cells in the microsporangia divide by meiosis to form haploid microspores that develop further by two mitotic divisions into immature male gametophytes (pollen grains). The four resulting cells consist of a large tube cell that forms the pollen tube, a generative cell that will produce two sperm by mitosis, and two prothallial cells that degenerate. These cells comprise a very reduced microgametophyte, that is contained within the resistant.

<h1>Irrigantion</h1>
<img src="images/irrigation.webp" width="320" height="300" align="left" style="margin:10px; border:#666 solid 1px;" />
Irrigation is the practice of applying controlled amounts of water to land to help grow crops, landscape plants, and lawns. Irrigation has been a key 
aspect of agriculture for over 5,000 years and has been developed by many cultures around the world. Irrigation helps to grow crops, maintain landscapes, 
and revegetate disturbed soils in dry areas and during times of below-average rainfall. In addition to these uses, irrigation is also employed to protect 
crops from frost, suppress weed growth in grain fields, and prevent soil consolidation. It is also used to cool livestock, reduce dust, dispose of sewage, 
and support mining operations. Drainage, which involves the removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given location, is often studied in conjunction 
with irrigation.

There are several methods of irrigation that differ in how water is supplied to plants. Surface irrigation, also known as gravity irrigation, is the oldest 
form of irrigation and has been in use for thousands of years. In sprinkler irrigation, water is piped to one or more central locations within the field and
 distributed by overhead high-pressure water devices. Micro-irrigation is a system that distributes water under low pressure through a piped network and 
applies it as a small discharge to each plant. Micro-irrigation uses less pressure and water flow than sprinkler irrigation. Drip irrigation delivers water 
directly to the root zone of plants.
