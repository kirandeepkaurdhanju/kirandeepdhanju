   Each shipment under this Agreement shall be evidenced by one or more transportation documents, which may include, but not be limited to, bills of lading, air waybills, ocean bills of lading, warehouse receipts manifests or any other documents purporting to control the custody and/or movement of the Goods (collectively, the “Transportation Documents”), showing the kind, quantity and condition of the Goods received and delivered by Broker or its subcontractors at the loading and unloading points, respectively.  In the case of a conflict with any term or condition of this Agreement, the Transportation Document or the carrier’s General Rules Tariff, the carrier’s General Rules Tariffs shall take precedence and govern, then the Transportation Document, then this Agreement – in that order of priority.  If a shipment originated outside the United States, the contract of carriage is with the Broker’s subsidiary, branch, or independent contractor who originally accepts the shipment.
For purposes of air and ocean transportation.  All such Transportation Documents are STRAIGHT/NON-NEGOTIABLE, have been prepared by Broker on behalf of the Customer, and shall therefore be deemed, conclusively, to have been prepared by the Customer and to bind Customer.  Any unauthorized alteration or use of a Transportation Document or tendering of shipments to any carrier other than that designated by the Broker, or the use of any Transportation Document not authorized or issued by the Broker shall VOID the Broker’s obligations to make any payments relating to the associated shipment and VOID all rate quotes.  If Customer does not complete all the documents required for carriage, or if the documents which Customer submits are not appropriate for the services, pick up or destination requested, the Customer hereby instructs the Broker, where permitted by law, to complete, correct and/or replace the documents for Customer at Customer’s expense; provided, however, the Broker is not obligated to do so.  If a substitute form of Transportation Document is needed to complete delivery of a shipment, and the Broker completes that document, the terms of that Transportation Document will govern. The Broker is not liable to the Customer or to any other person for any actions taken on. To navigate this process successfully, it is crucial to have the correct documentation in place. The five mandatory documents discussed here —commercial invoice, bill of lading, packing list, certificate of origin, and export licenses —are essential for ensuring smooth customs clearance, complying with trade regulations, and facilitating the efficient movement of goods across borders. By understanding and preparing these documents correctly with the help of a global shipping solution, exporters can minimize the risk of delays, penalties, and disruptions in their international shipping operations.
