One of the primary services offered by trucking companies is Full Truckload transportation. 
This service is best suited for large shipments that require the entire capacity of a truck, typically over 10,000 pounds or occupying more than 12 linear feet of space. 
FTL shipments are often faster than Less-than-Truckload shipments, as they generally travel directly from the point of origin to the destination without additional stops for consolidation or deconsolidation. 
This service is ideal for businesses that need to transport large quantities of goods quickly and efficiently.Full truckload, commonly referred to as FTL, is a type of shipping mode whereby a truck carries one dedicated shipment. In other words, the journey is reserved for one shipment only. FTL trucking has several advantages over the alternative trucking shipment mode, LTL, or less than a full truckload shipment.
For shipments that are large enough to fill or nearly fill an entire shipping container, full truckloads work out cheaper.
Full truckloads are much less encumbered by size and weight restrictions.

In addition to transportation, many trucking companies offer cross-docking and warehousing services to help businesses optimize their supply chain operations. 
Cross-docking involves the transfer of goods directly from the inbound truck to the outbound truck, minimizing the time spent in storage and reducing overall handling costs. 
Warehousing services provide short-term or long-term storage solutions for businesses that need extra space to manage inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, or just-in-time delivery requirements. 
By integrating transportation, cross-docking, and warehousing services, trucking companies can help streamline your logistics operations and improve overall efficiency. In terms of layout, cross-docking warehouses are typically long and narrow, with loading docks on both sides of the facility. This allows inbound shipments to be unloaded on one side and loaded onto outbound trucks on the other side. For larger facilities with many dock doors, T or X-shaped layouts may be used to minimize travel time and maximize efficiency.</div>

<h4>Intermodal Transportation</h4>
Intermodal transportation services involve the use of multiple modes of transport, such as trucks, trains, and ships, to move goods to their destination. 
This process allows trucking companies to optimize shipping routes, reduce costs, and minimize the environmental impact of transportation. 
By leveraging the strengths of each mode, intermodal services can offer more flexibility and efficiency in the logistics process. 
For instance, long-haul shipments can be transported via rail, while trucks handle the first and last-mile delivery. 
Trucking companies that offer intermodal services often work closely with rail and maritime carriers to provide seamless and streamlined logistics solutions. As international intermodal shipments travel between ocean carriers, trucks and trains, the product stays in the same container for the entirety of the trip. Domestic intermodal shipments travel in 53-foot containers. Although these shipments are referred to as “domestic intermodal,” products may still arrive from overseas. The key difference is that after products arrive at a port in 20- or 40-foot international containers, they are transferred to 53-foot domestic containers, whether at a cross dock facility, transload facility or distribution center. From there, they travel to inland destinations.</div>
