tractors, 4 by 4 combines and other harvesting tools like plough, combine harvester, rotavator or rotary tiller, disc harrow, leveler and happy 
seeder, super seeder, maize corn thresher, maize corn seeder and many more. This manchines will help you to sowing seeds in less time and produce 
the crops in more quantity, because this machines work properly.Different levels in crop production include:- primary and secondary level of 
tillage of the soil, seeding and planting, cultivation, fertilizer application and distribution, pest control, harvesting, irrigation, drainage, 
transporatation, handling the residues of earlier crops etc.  
          <br />Since in the earlier times, animals are the primary source of energy when it was about tough jobs in farming. later on steam power start 
replacing the same and the gas powered tractors took over, followed by diesel engines. in the developed nations, it caused lowering  the number 
of farmworkers. however,In the todays era, everyone wants easy works and complete them in less time. so farmers needs Agriculture machines for

seeds in rows directly without any prior seedbed perparation. the happy seeder is a tractor mounted machine that cuts and lifts rice straw, sows 
wheat into the soil, deposits the straw over the sown area as mulch and helping it retain its moisture and encouraging seed germination. The 
straw naturally decomposes over time, enriching the soil.
    <br /><b>
Super seeder:-
</b>
super seeder is one of the best wheat seeds bowing machine. the super seeder is no-till planter, towed behind a tractor, the sow seeds in 
rows seeds in a rows directly without any prior seedbed perparation. the super seeder is a tarctor mounted machine. it is helpful in retain its 
moisture and encouraging seed germination. Its environment friendly equipment.
 <br /><b>
Carrot seeder:-
</b>
carrot seeder is one of the best carrot seeds bowing machine. the carrot seeder is a no-till planter, towed behind a tractor, the sow seeds in 
rows seeds in a rows directly without any prior seedbed perparation. the carrot seeder is a tractor mounted machine. it is helpful in retain its 
moisture and encouraging seed germination. Its environment friendly equipment.
<br /><b>
Maize seeder:-
</b>
