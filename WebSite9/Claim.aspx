    All claims for loss, damage, delay or non-delivery must be made within one hundred twenty days of the shipping date, or such claims shall be deemed to be waived.  Original shipping carton and contents must be retained by consignee for inspection.  Acceptance of Goods by recipient without noting damage on the delivery notice shall be conclusive evidence that such Goods were delivered in good condition and without damage.
The filing of a claim does not relieve the responsible party for payment of freight charges.  Freight payment is necessary in order for a carrier to process a claim.  All freight cargo claims should be submitted immediately to the Broker to help ensure timely resolution. The Broker will attempt to assist in the resolution of freight claims, but has no responsibility or liability therefore.  No claim will be reviewed until all shipping and related charges have been paid to Broker. All packaging and containers must be made available for inspection by Broker.  Insurance claim payments, minus $100.00 USD deductible, will be made in U.S. dollars.  Where Broker files damage claim with carrier on behalf of Customer and receives recovery funds, the Broker has a lien on such recovery amounts and reserves the right to apply recovery amounts to open past due invoices on account.  This includes recovery amounts received from carrier for freight charges and/or product damage claim amounts.
All claims for overcharge shall be deemed waived if not presented to Broker within one hundred twenty days of the original invoice date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an account is more than sixty (60) days past due, Broker may apply overpayments, or other credits owed to Customer, against the oldest dated invoices.
All claims are to be submitted in writing by overnight or certified mail to the following physical and/or email address: Logistics Plus, Inc., 1406 Peach Street, Erie, Pennsylvania 16501, Attn: Claims Department, or LPClaims@logisticsplus.com
