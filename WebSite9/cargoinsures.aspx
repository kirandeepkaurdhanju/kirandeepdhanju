    No cargo insurance will be purchased or held by Broker unless Broker has agreed otherwise in writing with Customer. Customer, at its expense, may purchase a shipper’s interest insurance policy, in which event Broker will act solely as a representative for Customer, assisting the Customer with entering a separate contract for insurance between Customer and the insurance carrier.
Through the Customer’s purchase of a shipper’s interest insurance policy, which would be underwritten by National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PA, the enrolled Customer will receive an insurance certificate denoting insurance equal to the declared value amount entered covering Goods in transit subject to the terms and conditions contained therein.
FAILURE TO PURCHASE CARGO INSURANCE WILL RESULT IN CUSTOMER BEING LIMITED TO RECOVERY PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF CARRIER’S GENERAL RULES TARIFF.
Upon completion of the purchasing and approval process, including cargo insurance coverage acceptance and final shipment confirmation, a certificate of insurance will be issued to the indicated certificate holder by the end of the next business day.
THE BROKER IS NOT AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND DOES NOT OFFER OR PROVIDE INSURANCE. Further the Broker has no responsibility, liability, or involvement in the issuance of insurance, the denial of insurance, or in the payment of claims. In the event of cargo loss or damage, the certificate holder is to contact the claim agent noted on the certificate of insurance immediately. If the loss or damage is apparent, the consignee must note such loss or damage information on the Transportation Document/delivery receipt.  If the loss or damage is not apparent (concealed), the certificate holder must contact the claims agent noted on the certificate within five(5) calendar days after taking delivery.  Should any such insurance carrier dispute liability or refuse to settle a claim for any reason whatsoever, Customer agrees it will have no recourse against Broker.
