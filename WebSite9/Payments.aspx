    All charges are payable in US Dollars, due and payable NET fifteen days from the date of invoice by Broker, provided Customer’s credit application is approved.  Alternative terms may be required if the credit application is incomplete or Customer’s credit score does not meet Broker’s standards.  Any payment which is past due shall accrue interest daily at the rate of 1.5% per month on the outstanding balance due, or the highest rate of interest permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.  All funds received by the Broker will be applied to the oldest (based on pick-up date) invoiced Transportation Document that is outstanding.  Overpayments do not accrue interest and are subject to the Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  In the event the Broker retains an attorney or collection agency to collect unpaid charges or for the enforcement of the Agreement, all unpaid charges will be subject to a late payment penalty of 33%, and Customer shall also be liable for all attorneys’ and collection agency fees incurred, together with all related costs and expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer’s payment terms are always subject to credit approval.  Broker may perform a credit check based on the information provided at the time of enrollment by the Customer.  The amount of credit, if any, granted to the Customer is within Broker’s sole and absolute discretion.  When paying by credit card or electronic funds, the Customer agrees it will be responsible for all charges payable, including any adjustments, on account of such Customer’s shipment, plus a 3.5% credit card transaction fee.  These charges and adjustments, if any, will be automatically debited to the Customer’s credit card or bank account.
All shippers, consignors, consignees, third party freight forwarders and third party freight brokers are jointly and severally liable for the freight charges relating to a shipment under the Agreement.
The Customer shall be liable, jointly and severally, for all charges payable on account of such Customer’s shipment, including but not limited to transportation, fuel and other applicable accessorial charges, including all adjustments issued by the carrier(s) after the shipment, and all duties, customs assessments, governmental penalties and fines, taxes, and Broker’s attorney fees and legal costs allocable to this shipment and/or all disputes related thereto. The Broker shall have a lien on the shipment for all sums due it relating to this shipment or any other amounts owed by Customer. The Broker reserves the right to amend or adjust the original quoted amount or re-invoice the Customer if the original quoted amount was based upon incorrect information provided at the time of the original quote or if additional services by the carrier were required or otherwise authorized by the Customer to perform the pickup, transportation and delivery functions therein.  Customer is permitted thirty (30) business days from the date of the invoice to dispute any invoiced charges.  If the Broker does not receive a dispute within the allowable thirty (30) business days, the disputed item will be denied by the Broker.
